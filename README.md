# Hello-world
Hi, I am Abdellah, but if you find my name difficult to spell, you can call me Akira. So, I am studying at university, at the same time, I am learning Web-developing, as a back-end programmer, with the community "Zengineers".
I am happy to be part of this project, and as soon as I will be able to code as my pairs(at least as a junior programmer), I will help back my community.
